My name is Nicholas M Synovic. I am an Undergraduate student attending Loyola University Chicago and studying CS.

My current research/ work involves data collection, storage, and analysis all of which typically handle unorganized and/or uncategorized information. I have a special interest in politics and the meta-attributes of developers and their teams
